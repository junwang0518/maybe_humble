# Maybe Finance Migration Documentation

This folder contains all documentation related to migrating Maybe from a Rails monolith to a modern SPA with event-driven microservices architecture.

## Documents

### üìã [MIGRATION_PLAN.md](./MIGRATION_PLAN.md)
Comprehensive 18-month migration strategy covering:
- **Service Boundaries**: Breaking down the monolith into 8 microservices
- **Frontend Migration**: Rails + Hotwire ‚Üí React/Next.js SPA
- **Event-Driven Architecture**: Event sourcing and CQRS patterns
- **Data Migration**: Strangler fig pattern and dual-write strategies
- **Authentication**: Session-based ‚Üí JWT + service mesh
- **Timeline**: Phased approach with risk mitigation
- **Cost Analysis**: Infrastructure and development costs

### üèóÔ∏è [SOURCE_CODE_LAYOUT.md](./SOURCE_CODE_LAYOUT.md)
Detailed source code organization strategy covering:
- **Monorepo Structure**: Organizing legacy + new services + frontend
- **Service Architecture**: Individual microservice code organization
- **Frontend Structure**: React/Next.js SPA with shared components
- **Shared Libraries**: Event schemas, types, utilities
- **Infrastructure as Code**: Kubernetes, Terraform, Docker
- **Migration Tools**: Scripts for data migration and validation
- **Development Workflow**: Local development setup

## Migration Overview

### Current State
- **Frontend**: Rails + Hotwire (Turbo + Stimulus) + ViewComponents
- **Backend**: Rails monolith with PostgreSQL
- **Integration**: Plaid API for bank connectivity
- **Deployment**: Single application deployment

### Target State
- **Frontend**: React/Next.js SPA with TypeScript
- **Backend**: 8 microservices with event-driven communication
- **Data**: Event sourcing for financial transactions
- **Infrastructure**: Kubernetes with service mesh
- **Integration**: API Gateway + JWT authentication

### Key Services
1. **Identity Service**: Authentication, users, families
2. **Account Service**: Account management, balances
3. **Transaction Service**: Financial transactions (event sourced)
4. **Integration Service**: Plaid sync, external APIs
5. **Import Service**: CSV processing, data transformation
6. **Investment Service**: Holdings, securities, market data
7. **Analytics Service**: Budgets, reporting, AI features
8. **Notification Service**: Alerts, webhooks, chat

## Migration Phases

### Phase 1: Foundation (Months 1-3)
- Infrastructure setup (K8s, service mesh, event infrastructure)
- Frontend foundation (React/Next.js, state management)
- Event-driven architecture design

### Phase 2: Low-Risk Services (Months 4-6)
- Analytics Service (read-only)
- Notification Service (AI chat, alerts)
- Import Service (CSV processing)

### Phase 3: Core Services (Months 7-12)
- Integration Service (Plaid sync)
- Investment Service (holdings, securities)
- Account Service (core financial data)

### Phase 4: Transaction Service (Months 13-15)
- Transaction Service (highest risk, event sourced)
- Complete event sourcing implementation
- Remove database foreign keys

### Phase 5: Frontend & Cleanup (Months 16-18)
- Complete ViewComponent ‚Üí React migration
- Real-time WebSocket connections
- Monolith retirement

## Key Principles

### üõ°Ô∏è **Risk Mitigation**
- Gradual migration with strangler fig pattern
- Dual-write for data consistency
- Feature flags for safe rollouts
- Comprehensive testing at each step

### üí∞ **Financial Data Integrity**
- Event sourcing for audit trails
- Immutable financial events
- Balance reconciliation processes
- Regulatory compliance validation

### üöÄ **Zero Downtime**
- Blue-green deployments
- Circuit breakers with fallback
- Database snapshots before migrations
- Rollback procedures for each phase

### üîß **Development Velocity**
- Monorepo for easy navigation
- Shared libraries prevent duplication
- Independent service development
- Consistent tooling and processes

## Getting Started

1. **Read Migration Plan**: Start with `MIGRATION_PLAN.md` for the complete strategy
2. **Review Code Layout**: Check `SOURCE_CODE_LAYOUT.md` for implementation details
3. **Understand Current Architecture**: Review existing Maybe codebase
4. **Plan Phase 1**: Focus on infrastructure and frontend foundation

## Future Documents

As the migration progresses, additional documents will be added:
- **Service Design Documents**: Detailed specs for each microservice
- **API Contracts**: OpenAPI specs and event schemas
- **Testing Strategy**: Unit, integration, and e2e testing approaches
- **Deployment Guides**: CI/CD pipelines and deployment procedures
- **Monitoring & Observability**: Metrics, logging, and alerting setup
- **Security Architecture**: Authentication, authorization, and data protection
- **Performance Benchmarks**: Load testing and optimization results
