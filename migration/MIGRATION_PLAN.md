# Maybe App Migration Plan: Monolith → SPA + Event-Driven Microservices

## Executive Summary

This document outlines a comprehensive 18-month migration strategy to transform Maybe from a Rails monolith with Hotwire frontend to a modern SPA with event-driven microservices architecture. The migration prioritizes financial data integrity, zero-downtime deployment, and regulatory compliance throughout the transformation.

## Event-Driven Architecture Design

### Event Schema Examples
```typescript
// Core Domain Events
interface AccountCreated {
  eventId: string;
  eventType: 'AccountCreated';
  aggregateId: string; // accountId
  familyId: string;
  accountData: {
    name: string;
    accountType: string;
    currency: string;
    initialBalance: number;
  };
  metadata: {
    timestamp: Date;
    version: number;
    causationId?: string;
    correlationId?: string;
  };
}

interface TransactionProcessed {
  eventId: string;
  eventType: 'TransactionProcessed';
  aggregateId: string; // transactionId
  familyId: string;
  accountId: string;
  transactionData: {
    amount: number;
    currency: string;
    description: string;
    date: Date;
    categoryId?: string;
    merchantId?: string;
    tags: string[];
  };
  metadata: {
    timestamp: Date;
    version: number;
    source: 'user' | 'plaid' | 'import';
    causationId?: string;
    correlationId?: string;
  };
}

interface PlaidSyncCompleted {
  eventId: string;
  eventType: 'PlaidSyncCompleted';
  aggregateId: string; // plaidItemId
  familyId: string;
  syncData: {
    status: 'success' | 'failed' | 'partial';
    accountIds: string[];
    transactionCount: number;
    newTransactionIds: string[];
    error?: string;
  };
  metadata: {
    timestamp: Date;
    version: number;
    causationId?: string;
    correlationId?: string;
  };
}
```

### Event Flow Patterns
```yaml
# Transaction Creation Flow
transaction_creation_saga:
  steps:
    1. Command: CreateTransaction
    2. Event: TransactionCreated
    3. Event: AccountBalanceRecalculated
    4. Event: CategoryAssigned (if applicable)
    5. Event: NotificationSent (if configured)

# Plaid Sync Flow
plaid_sync_saga:
  steps:
    1. Command: StartPlaidSync
    2. Event: PlaidSyncStarted
    3. Event: PlaidDataFetched
    4. Event: TransactionsProcessed
    5. Event: AccountsUpdated
    6. Event: PlaidSyncCompleted
    7. Event: NotificationSent

# Import Processing Flow
import_processing_saga:
  steps:
    1. Command: ProcessImport
    2. Event: ImportStarted
    3. Event: FileValidated
    4. Event: DataTransformed
    5. Event: TransactionsBatchCreated
    6. Event: ImportCompleted
    7. Event: NotificationSent
```

## Authentication & Authorization

### JWT Token Design
```typescript
interface MaybeJWT {
  // Standard JWT claims
  iss: 'maybe-identity-service';
  sub: string; // userId
  aud: string[]; // target services
  exp: number; // expiration
  iat: number; // issued at
  jti: string; // JWT ID

  // Maybe-specific claims
  family_id: string; // Critical for data isolation
  scopes: string[]; // read, read_write
  session_id: string; // For session tracking
  user_role: 'user' | 'admin' | 'super_admin';
  features: string[]; // ai_enabled, etc.
}

interface ServiceToken {
  iss: 'maybe-identity-service';
  aud: string; // target service
  exp: number;
  service_name: string;
  permissions: string[];
  correlation_id?: string;
}
```

### Identity Service API
```yaml
identity_service_endpoints:
  authentication:
    - POST /auth/login
    - POST /auth/refresh
    - POST /auth/logout
    - GET /auth/validate

  authorization:
    - GET /families/{id}/members
    - GET /users/{id}/permissions
    - POST /users/{id}/sessions

  service_auth:
    - POST /service-tokens
    - POST /service-tokens/validate

  oauth2:
    - GET /oauth/authorize
    - POST /oauth/token
    - POST /oauth/revoke
```

## Data Migration Strategy

### Database Decomposition
```sql
-- Phase 1: Logical Separation (maintain foreign keys)
CREATE DATABASE identity_service;
CREATE DATABASE account_service;
CREATE DATABASE transaction_service;
CREATE DATABASE integration_service;
CREATE DATABASE import_service;
CREATE DATABASE investment_service;
CREATE DATABASE analytics_service;
CREATE DATABASE notification_service;

-- Phase 2: Data Migration Scripts
-- Identity Service
COPY (SELECT id, email, encrypted_password, family_id, created_at, updated_at 
      FROM users) TO '/tmp/users.csv' WITH CSV HEADER;

-- Account Service  
COPY (SELECT id, name, balance, currency, family_id, accountable_type, 
             accountable_id, created_at, updated_at 
      FROM accounts) TO '/tmp/accounts.csv' WITH CSV HEADER;

-- Transaction Service
COPY (SELECT t.id, t.name, e.amount, e.currency, e.date, e.account_id,
             t.category_id, t.merchant_id, t.created_at, t.updated_at
      FROM transactions t 
      JOIN entries e ON e.entryable_id = t.id 
      WHERE e.entryable_type = 'Transaction') TO '/tmp/transactions.csv' WITH CSV HEADER;

-- Phase 3: Remove Foreign Key Constraints
ALTER TABLE accounts DROP CONSTRAINT fk_accounts_family_id;
ALTER TABLE transactions DROP CONSTRAINT fk_transactions_account_id;
-- ... continue for all cross-service references
```

### Strangler Fig Pattern Implementation
```ruby
# Gradual migration with dual writes
class TransactionCreator
  def initialize
    @legacy_enabled = Rails.application.config.legacy_transaction_service
    @new_service = TransactionServiceClient.new
  end

  def create(transaction_params)
    result = nil
    
    # Always write to legacy system during migration
    if @legacy_enabled
      result = Transaction.create!(transaction_params)
    end
    
    # Also write to new service
    begin
      new_transaction = @new_service.create_transaction(
        transform_params_for_new_service(transaction_params)
      )
      
      # During cutover, prefer new service result
      result = new_transaction unless @legacy_enabled
    rescue => e
      # Log error but don't fail if legacy is primary
      Rails.logger.error "New service failed: #{e.message}"
      Sentry.capture_exception(e)
      
      raise e unless @legacy_enabled
    end
    
    result
  end

  private

  def transform_params_for_new_service(params)
    {
      family_id: params[:account].family_id,
      account_id: params[:account_id],
      amount: params[:amount],
      currency: params[:currency] || params[:account].currency,
      description: params[:name],
      date: params[:date],
      category_id: params[:category_id],
      merchant_id: params[:merchant_id],
      tags: params[:tag_ids] || []
    }
